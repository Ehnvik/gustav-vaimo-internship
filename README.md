## General ideas

1. Track the progress
2. Start working with the project board that has to be the same in many companies
3. Use GIT as much as possible
4. Start working with external repo
5. Have auto-tests for merged code such as ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier
6. Have code review on each PR
7. Have reference links for each lecture and homeworks such as call records, Adobe Commerce documentation, assets (images, archives), and tips
